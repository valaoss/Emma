      <h2>What is this place?</h2>
      <p>
        This site is a small, personal blog where ideas, notes, and experiences are collected
        in one clean, organized space. No clickbait, no ads, no distractions – just straightforward
        posts that you can read comfortably.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some entries are longer reflections, others are short thoughts or quick notes.
        The goal is not perfection, but consistency: writing often, learning in public,
        and watching how thoughts evolve over time.
